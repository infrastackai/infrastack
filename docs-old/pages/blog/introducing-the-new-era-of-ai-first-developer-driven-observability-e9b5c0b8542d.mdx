In the constantly evolving world of software development, the rise of microservices, containerization, and Kubernetes has significantly accelerated the ability to deploy rapidly. As cloud-native technologies have evolved, so too have the challenges involved in monitoring and understanding these dynamic environments.
To cut through these challenges, InfraStack is developing an AI-first, developer-driven observability platform that enables developers to independently observe, troubleshoot, and decode the complexities of advanced cloud-native application stacks, diminishing the dependency on the niche expertise of individual SREs, DevOps, and infrastructure experts.


## The Problem with Relying on a SingleÂ Expert
Relying on an individual expert is a critical vulnerability for cloud native ecosystems. While it's just not safe or sustainable, many organizations continue to have exactly this sort of single point of failure, because not enough people understand how to observe and resolve issues with complex systems.
Observability solutions should empower all developers to resolve issues, enabling them to share the responsibility and preventing burnout while increasing system resilience.


##Broken Viewpoints
In the world of large-scale software systems, majority of the monitoring and observability tools only provide fragmented views. What teams really need is a single observability platform that brings together metrics, logs, and traces into a clear and understandable snapshot, allowing developers to quickly grasp the full picture and take proactive actions.


## Today's Observability Tools Aren't Designed For Developers

Traditional monitoring platforms often fail to meet the level of observability that developers truly need. While these platforms offer comprehensive dashboards, they're also complex, crowded, and present uncorrelated data visualizations. These systems are primarily built to meet the needs of DevOps, Site Reliability, Traffic, and Infrastructure Experts for production workloads. They require 100% human involvement, making them time-consuming and demanding for developers to navigate. Moreover, these platforms are notoriously expensive, which can be a significant barrier for many development teams.
With the rise of AI-first tooling and a focus on developer empowerment, a new approach to observability has emerged. AI-powered tools and insights give developers a holistic view of their application stacks, and can actively guide them in identifying potential issues, and making informed decisions that optimize performance and reliability.

## The Key Advantages of AI-First, Developer-Driven Observability:

- Empowering Developers: Developers are given the tools and capabilities to directly and independently observe, troubleshoot, and fully understand complex application stacks. This empowers them to proactively address issues and optimize the performance of their applications.
- Efficiency and Cost Savings: By reducing the reliance on constant support from DevOps, SRE, and infrastructure teams, developers can save time and resources. AI-driven observability platforms provide efficient and cost-effective solutions for observing and troubleshooting complex application stacks.
- Holistic View and Insights: AI-driven observability platforms offer a holistic view of complex, multi layered application stacks, bringing together metrics, logs, traces, and other telemetry data in a user friendly, human readable format. This condensed presentation gives developers real insights into the behavior of their applications and allows them to identify potential issues by focusing directly on metrics that are timely and relevant.
- Integration and Collaboration: AI-first observability platforms seamlessly integrate with existing development workflows, ensuring a smooth and streamlined experience for developers. Collaboration between developers, DevOps, SRE, and infrastructure teams is enhanced, enabling effective troubleshooting and issue resolution.

In conclusion, the new era of AI-first, developer-driven observability will revolutionize the way developers manage the complex cloud native application stacks. Using a next generation of powerful tools and insights, developers can independently observe and troubleshoot their applications, leading to improved performance, reliability, and overall developer productivity. With AI-first observability, developers are empowered to take control of their application stacks, significantly boosting productivity and reveling in the joy of innovation and seamless problem-solving.
