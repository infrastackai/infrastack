#### What you will learn
- How to dockerize your Next.js application with OpenTelemetry via infrastack.ai

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- An infrastack.ai account
- A Next.js application configured with the infrastack.ai SDK, see [Integrate OpenTelemetry for Next.js with infrastack.ai](/documentation/integrate-opentelemetry-for-nextjs-with-infrastack)
<Info>
The application should be on the `nodejs` runtime. The `edge` runtime is not supported at this time.

#### Overview
Docker is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications with ease. With the power of infrastack.ai and OpenTelemetry, you can get comprehensive observability for your Next.js application.

After you have configured your application with the infrastack.ai SDK by following the [Integrate OpenTelemetry for Next.js with infrastack.ai](/documentation/integrate-opentelemetry-for-nextjs-with-infrastack) guide, you can dockerize your application by following these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure next.config.mjs">
In your `next.config.mjs` file, :
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone', // For web services/Docker
  experimental: {
    instrumentationHook: true, // To enable instrumentation
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```
This will allow the Next.js application to be run as a web service.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a Dockerfile">
Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project with the following content:
```dockerfile Dockerfile
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

FROM base as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

RUN npm run build

FROM base as runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

RUN mkdir .next

RUN chown nextjs:nodejs .next

COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENV PORT 3000

CMD HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0" node server.js
```
In this optimized dockerfile, we are using the `base` image as the base image for the builder and runner stages. The `builder` stage is used to build the application and the `runner` stage is used to run the application.
<Tip>You can change the port if you will not be using the default port of 3000.</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a dockerignore file">
Create a `.dockerignore` file in the root of your project with the following content:
```dockerignore .dockerignore
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
node_modules
.next
README.md
npm-debug.log
!.next/static
!.next/standalone
.git
```
This will prevent unnecessary files from being included in the Docker image. You can add more files to the ignore list if you see fit.
</Step>

<Step title="Build the Docker image">
Build the Docker image with the following command:
```bash
docker image build -t nextjs-example:latest .        
```
<Tip>You can change the name `nextjs-example:latest` to your desired name and tag.</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Docker container">
Run the Docker container with the following command:
```bash
docker container run -p 3000:3000 -e INFRASTACK_API_KEY=<your-infrastack-api-key> nextjs-example:latest
```
</Step>

<Step title="Visit your application">
You can verify that the application is working by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
<Tip>Now, you can check your data in the [infrastack.ai](https://app.infrastack.ai) dashboard.</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Optional: Deploy to a cloud provider">
You can push the Docker image to a registry such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) or [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-package-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) and then deploy it to a cloud provider of your choice.
