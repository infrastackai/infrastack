#### What you will learn
- Configuring the infrastack.ai Javascript SDK for your needs

#### Prerequisites
- An application using the infrastack.ai Javascript SDK `@infrastack/otel`

### Overview
Our Javascript SDK provides flexibility to developers to configure the SDK. There are 2 ways to configure the SDK:
- Via environment variables
- Via code

<Warning> What you provide in the code will override what you provide in the environment variables </Warning>

### Setting the API Key
API key is required when you initialize the SDK to use it with infrastack.ai. 

To set the API key, you can set the `apiKey` option in the `startOtel` function or set the `INFRASTACK_API_KEY` environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript instrumentation.ts
import { startOtel } from '@infrastack/otel'
startOtel({
  apiKey: 'sk-1*****f5af',
  serviceName: 'my-service'
})
```
```properties .env
INFRASTACK_API_KEY=sk-1*****f5af
```

```bash terminal
export INFRASTACK_API_KEY=sk-1*****f5af
```
</CodeGroup>

---

### Setting the service name
The service name is used to identify the service in the [infrastack.ai dashboard](https://app.infrastack.ai).

To set the service name, you can set the `serviceName` option in the `startOtel` function or set the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable.
If you do not provide a service name from either of the options, it will generate a random service name.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript instrumentation.ts
import { startOtel } from '@infrastack/otel'
startOtel({
  serviceName: 'my-service'
})
```

```properties .env
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
```

```bash terminal
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
```
</CodeGroup>

---

### Setting the service version
The service version is used to identify the version of the service in the [infrastack.ai dashboard](https://app.infrastack.ai). 
It becomes useful to capture deployment information and other versioning information. 

If you do not provide a service version from either of the options, it will default to `0.0.1`.

To set the service version, you can set the `serviceVersion` option in the `startOtel` function or set the `OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION` environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript instrumentation.ts
import { startOtel } from '@infrastack/otel'
startOtel({
  serviceVersion: '1.0.0',
  serviceName: 'my-service'
})
```
```properties .env
OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION=1.0.0
```

```bash terminal
export OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION=1.0.0
```
</CodeGroup>

---

### Development mode
Development mode is disabled by default. In that case, it will not log anything to the console and will use `BatchSpanProcessor` for span exports.

Visit the Documentation [OpenTelemetry - Picking the right span processor](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/instrumentation/#picking-the-right-span-processor) for more information. 

To toggle development mode, you can set the `developmentMode` option to `true` in the `startOtel` function or set the `INFRASTACK_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` environment variable to `true`.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript instrumentation.ts
import { startOtel } from '@infrastack/otel'
startOtel({
  developmentMode: true,
  serviceName: 'my-service'
})
```

```properties .env
INFRASTACK_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true
```
 
```bash terminal
export INFRASTACK_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning> Development mode is only recommended for development purposes. It is not recommended for production. </Warning>

---

### Disabling the SDK logs
By default, when you set up the SDK and run your application, you will see logs in the console as below:

```
Exporter endpoint is set as: https://collector.infrastack.ai
Found an API Key: sk-1*****f5af
Service name is set as: infrastack-example
Service version is set as: 0.0.1
Application is now instrumented with infrastack.ai
```
To disable them for cleaner startup logs for your application, you can set the `logsEnabled` option to `false` in the `startOtel` function **or** set the `INFRASTACK_LOGS_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`.
<CodeGroup>
```javascript instrumentation.ts
import { startOtel } from '@infrastack/otel'
startOtel({
  logsEnabled: false,
  serviceName: 'my-service'
})
```

```properties .env
INFRASTACK_LOGS_ENABLED=false
```

```bash terminal
export INFRASTACK_LOGS_ENABLED=false
```
</CodeGroup>

---

### Tags
You can define a set of tags to enrich your spans. It is also recommended to add the tag for your environment (Production, Staging, Development etc.)

All of these tags will be added to every span that is created.

To set the tags, you can set the `tags` option in the `startOtel` function or set the `INFRASTACK_TAGS` environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript instrumentation.ts
import { startOtel, Tag } from '@infrastack/otel'
const tags: Tag[] = [{ key: 'environment', value: 'production' }]
startOtel({
  tags: tags,
  serviceName: 'my-service'
})
```
```properties .env
INFRASTACK_TAGS='[{"key": "environment", "value": "production"}]'
```
```bash terminal
export INFRASTACK_TAGS='[{"key": "environment", "value": "production"}]'
```
</CodeGroup>

--- 

### Configuring the exporter endpoint
By default, the SDK will use the `infrastack.ai` collector endpoint. However, it can be overriden to use a different endpoint.

To set the endpoint, you can set the `endpoint` option in the `startOtel` function or set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript instrumentation.ts
import { startOtel } from '@infrastack/otel'
startOtel({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:4317',
  serviceName: 'my-service'
})
```
```properties .env
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
```
```bash terminal
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
```
</CodeGroup>
